1) Ensure that your local branch is master with git branch
2) Create a new file note.txt in local branch master.
3) Add it to staging area.
4) Commit with message 'ver 1'
5) Push to remote called origin to the branch master.
6) And now we are ready for the test.
6.1) we create a new branch called feature1 in github
6.2) we then fetch from github with git fetch
6.3) doing git branch -a gives
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/feature1
  remotes/origin/master
6.4) now switch to feature1 branch in local with git checkout feature1
6.5) We added new instructions which is feature 1
6.6) We commit and push to feature1 branch with git push origin feature1
7) While working on feature1, we change master. We switch to master with git checkout master and then add this line.
8) while working on feature1 we change the original code by switching to master
now we need to merge with master so switch to master with git checkout master
git merge feature1
Auto-merging note.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in note.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
We manually edit the file and merge the content, then add to staging area and commit and pushed
We then switch to feature1 and manually fix the file there also
Then we add it to staging area, commit and push
Now again switch to master and merge
9) Now that we have merged feature1, we can remove the branch with git branch -d feature1
